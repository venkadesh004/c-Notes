Data types and Sizes:

char: 
A single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set.

int:
An integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine.

float:
Single-precision floating point.

double:
Double-precision floating point.

Size:
short int < int < long int

Signed or unsigned:
Let int be 8 bis
Unsigned numbers are always positive
numbers of 0-255 will be stored
Singed numbers includes both
numbers of -128 - 127 will be stored.

long increases the size.
The acutal size of these data types depends on the hardware

Rules for constructing c identifiers:
1. The first character should be an alphabet or underscore, it can be followed by character, digit or underscore
2. It should not begin with any numerical digit.
3. Both uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore they are case sensitive.
4. Commas and blank spaces cannot be specified within an identifier.
5. Keywords cannot be represented as an identifier.
6. The length of the identifiers should not be more than 31 characters.
7. It should be short, meaningful and easy to read.
