Functions:

In c, we can divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as Function. 
The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. 
A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.

return_type function_name(data_type parameter...) {
    // code to be executed
}

Defining a function:
A function is said to be defined when the code inside the function is written.
We can directly define a function, if we write the funciton before the main function.

Declaring a function:
Syntax:
return_type function_name(data_type parameter...);
We need to declare a funciton mandatorly if it the function is defined after the main function.
