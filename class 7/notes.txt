Statements and blocks:

An expression such as x = 0 or i++ or printf(...) becomes a statement when it is followed by semicolon.

Examples:
x = 0;
i++;
printf("Welcome");

Braces { and } are used to group declaration and statements together within a compound statement or blocks.

Nested block:
A nested block in C is an statement that is the target of another statement.
Nested statements means an statement inside another statement.

If we declare a variable inside a block then the scope is within the block.

If-else:
The if-else statement is used to express decisions:

Syntax:
if (expression) {
    statement 1;
} else {
    statement 2;
}

Else part is optional
Expression is evaluated and if it is true(non zero value), statement 1 is executed.
If expression is evaluated to false(zero), statement 2 is executed.

else if:

Syntax:
if (expression 1) {
    statement 1;
} else if (expression 2) {
    statement 2;
} else {
    statement 3;
}
