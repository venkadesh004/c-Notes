#include is a command which tells the pre processor to include the particluar file in the program

stdio contains all the declaration of the function related to IO

The main() function it tells the c program to start from there

"\n" stands for adding new line.

when we write the main function in int then return 0; must be used. 

Usually it is a good practise to use return statements in the main funation. 
When any other program calls it, it can get to know that the program has been ended using return 0;
if return -1 came then it is an error.
