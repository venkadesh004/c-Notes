Recursion:

Any function which calls itself is called recursion functoin, and such function calls are called recursive calls.
Recursive involves several number of recursion calls. It is important to impose a terminaiton condition of recurison.
Generally, iterative solutions are more efficient than recursion since function call is always overhead.
Any problem that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively.

Recursive functions:
A recursive function performs the tasks by dividing into th esubtasks.
There is a terminaiton condition defined in the function which satisfies by some specific subtask. After this, the recurison stops and the final result is returned from the function.

If we want to write code which requires less time then iterative is best.
If we want to write code which looks smaller then we need to use recursive.
