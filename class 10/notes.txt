Relational and Bitwise Operators:

Relational Operators:
    A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If the relational is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.
Relational Operators are used in decision making and loops.
Exmaples of relational Operators are ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.

Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise AND:
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation.
Bitwise AND operator &; The output of Bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1.
If either bit of an operand is 0. The result of corresponding bit is evalved to 0.

Bitwise OR:
Operator: |.
The output of Bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1.
In c Programming, Bitwise OR operator is denoted by |.

Bitwise XOR:
The result of Bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by ^.

Bitwise complement:
Bitwise complement operator is an unary operator. It changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1. It is denoted by ~.
