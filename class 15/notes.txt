Switch:

The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and branches accordingly.

switch (expression) {
    case const-expr:
        statements;
    case const-expr:
        statements;
    default:
        statements;
}
 
Each case is labeled by one or more integer-values constants or constant expression and if a case matches the expression value, execution states at that case.
All case expressions must be different, The case labeled default is executed if the cases are not satisfied.
A default is optional. If it isn't there and if none of the cases match, no execution of statements takes place.
Cases and the default clause can occur in any order.
Break statements are useful when you want your program-flow to stop when it gets satisfied with one statement.
