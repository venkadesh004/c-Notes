Register storage class:

The access time of the register variable is faster than the automatic variables.
The register keyword is used for the variable which should be stored in the CPU register.
We can store pointers into the register, i.e., a register can store the address of a variable. 

If we try to print the address of the variable assigned in register, it will not. It will show an error.
