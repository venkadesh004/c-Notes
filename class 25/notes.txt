Recursion:

While using recursion we use if else methods to find whether to continue or not. 
If the condition fails and stops then it is called termination condition or anchor condition or anchoring or base condition.

Head recurison:
if we call the recursion at first then it is called head recurison.

Tail recurison:
if we do some condition and call the recurison at the end then it is called tail recurison.

Activation record:
If we call a function, Activation record is the records that are been created while execution of the function.
Once the function anchors the the records get poped from the memory.
