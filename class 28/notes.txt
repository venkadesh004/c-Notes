Introduction to pointers:

Pointer:
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. 
Like any variables or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.
You can declare pointers like below

int* p;

We declare it as a int so that we can perform pointer arithmetic, i.e., if we say p++ then it should point to the next memory location.

int b;
int* p;
p = &b;

Here we save the address of the b in the pointer p.

*p prints the value inside the address.
