Pointers and Arrays:

Array: 
An array is a variable that can store multiple values.

Syntax:
dataType arrayName[arraySize];

For example, if you want to store 50 integers, you can create an array for it.
Example int array[50];

If you know the address of the first element in the array, we can traverse accross the array using the pointer addition. 

Initializing an array:

It is possible to initialize an array during declaration.
int marks[4] = {16, 11, 8, 17};

You can also initialize an array like this.
int marks[] = {16, 11, 8, 17};

Here, we haven't specified the size. However, these can be specified without its size when we initialize the array to them.

Modifiying array values:
We can Modify the values of Array elements.
Example: int marks[4] = {16, 11, 8, 17};

// Changing the third element of array to 20.
marks[2] = 20;

// Changing the fourth element of array to 0
marks[3] = 0;
