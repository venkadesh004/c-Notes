Passing a value to a function:

Methods to pass the values to function:
1. Call by value.
2. Call by reference.

In C programming language the values are passed by call by value.
But in c we can manipulate call by value in such a way that it is call by reference.

Call by values:
The method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
By defualt, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a funciton cannot after the argument used to call the function.

Call by reference:
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter.
Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call.
This means that changes are made to the parameter affect the argument.
