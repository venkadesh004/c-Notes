While loop:

A while loop repeatedly executes a target statements as long as given condition is true.

Syntax:

while (expression) {
    statements;
}

The expression is evaluated. If it is non zero, statements are executed and expression is re-evaluated this cycle continues until expression becomes zero, at which point execution resumes after loop.
