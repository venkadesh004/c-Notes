Loops:

for loop:

Syntax:
for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement) {
    // statements inside the body of the loop
}

we can also write:
for (; testExpression; ) {
    // code
}

if testExpression is empty then it would execute an infinite loop.

The initializationStatement is executed first and only one time.
Next the condition is evaluated. If it is true the loop continues else it comes out.
After the completion of the code inside the incrementation occurs.
