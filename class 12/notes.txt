do while loop:

A do while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
Unlike for and while loop, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do..while loop in C programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

Syntax:
do {
    statement(s);
} while (condition);

If the condition is true the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the statement(s) is executed again.
This process repeats until the given condition becomes false.
