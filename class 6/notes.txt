Enum and type conversions:

Enum data types:
The enum is also known as the enumerated type. It si a user-defined data type that consists of integer values, and it provides meaningful names to these values.
The use of enum in C makes the program easy to understand and maintain.
The enum is defined by using the enum keyword.

enum boolean(NO, YES);

enum months(jan=1, feb, march, april, may, june, july, august, september, october, november, december);
All the other months will be given a value as the previous one plus one.


Type conversions:
a(16 bits)+b(32 bits) --> Cannot be done!
To perform compiler converts it from 16 bits to 32 bits.
a(32 bits)+b(32 bits)
This process is called implicit type casting.

Explicit type conversion:
double x = 1.2;
int sum = (int)x + 1;

tohis process is also called type casting and it is user defined.
Here we can type cast the result to make it of a particular data type.
